			<story-text>Welcome to Survivor: Text Based Edition\nYou are driving up the mountain to go on a spontaneous camping trip.  On your way up you notice a side road that is closed to traffic.  You feel brave with your Jeep and decide to go up it.  A few hours up the road you start to get very sleepy, but you still have not found a suitable camping site and push on.  You nod off and crash into a tree getting knocked out in the process.  As you come to you notice it is snowing, night time, and you are trapped in your car.
